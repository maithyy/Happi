<b>Happi is a mental and physical health app that recommends activities to do based on user input and data from Apple HealthKit.</b>

The app provides users an overall score based on 3 metrics:
- Happiness score determined by the users' journal entry
- Sleep score determined by hours slept from Apple HealthKit
- Fitness score determined by user set goals and data from Apple HealthKit

Users can enter in a daily journal entry and receive a happiness score which is deterimined using text sentiment analysis from Google Cloudâ€™s Natural Language API.
