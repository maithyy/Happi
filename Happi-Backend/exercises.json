The range of motion is fairly small, but it still does a great job of working these hard-to-isolate muscles. Like most crunch variations, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.",

    "Title": "Dumbbell goblet squat-",
    "Desc": "The goblet squat is a popular lower-body exercise in which a dumbbell or kettlebell is held in front of the chest with two hands, approximating how you might hold a heavy goblet. It is used as a teaching tool to help instruct and develop proper squat form, but is also effective for building size in the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. It can be performed for low reps to build strength, or for higher reps to build muscle and conditioning.",
